                 <p>Hey! My name is Lorenzo Jennings, and I'm a second-year at Northwestern University double majoring in Math Education and Statistics with minors in Computer Science and Music and a certificate in Leadership. I use he/him pronouns, and I'm interested in utilizing technology within math classrooms to enhance the educational experience for students. </p>
                 <p>I grew up in the suburbs of Chicago and am currently studying and working in Evanston, IL. I am the drum major of the Northwestern "Wilcat" Marching Band with one of our recent performances shown below. </p>
                 <p>I'm also very passionate about backpacking. Before entering college, I took a gap year where I worked as a math tutor and medical scribe before hiking 2193.1 miles from Georgia to Maine along the Appalachian Trail. The picture shown on the left was taken when I finished my trek this past summer across Vermont's Long Trail. An instagram post that I published after finishing this trail is shown below. I currently hope to take April through August of 2023 to hike the entire length of the Pacitic Crest Trail from Mexico to Canada. </p>

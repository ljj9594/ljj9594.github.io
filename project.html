                 <p>For my final programming class in the computer science sequence at Northwestern, I used C++ to code a working version of Bubble Pop, the game involving shooting colored balls at other colored balls at the screen to destroy them and win points! </p>
                 <p>I worked with a partner on this project, and this experience taught both of us about debugging, user gameplay, user design, programming collaboration, and specific facets about the C++ programming language that we didn't cover in lecture.  </p>
                 <p>I hope to continue studying game design and how it can be used to enhance the educational experience within the classroom. </p>
